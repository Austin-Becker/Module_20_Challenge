/*
Joint Savings Account
---------------------

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, you will create a solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses that are then able to control a joint savings account. Your smart contract will use ether management functions to implement 
various requirements from the financial institution to provide the features of the joint savings account.

The Starting file provided for this challenge contains a `pragma` for solidity version `5.0.0`.
You will do the following:

1. Create and work within a local blockchain development environment using the JavaScript VM provided by the Remix IDE.

2. Script and deploy a **JointSavings** smart contract.

3. Interact with your deployed smart contract to transfer and withdraw funds.

    Inside the new contract define the following variables:
    - Two variables of type `address payable` named `accountOne` and `accountTwo`
    - A variable of type `address public` named `lastToWithdraw`
    - Two variables of type `uint public` named `lastWithdrawAmount` and `contractBalance`.

Now that your contract is deployed, it’s time to test its functionality! After each step, capture a screenshot of the execution, and then 
save it in a folder named `Execution_Results`. You’ll share this folder with your final submission.

To interact with your deployed smart contract, complete the following steps:

1. Use the `setAccounts` function to define the authorized Ethereum address that will be able to withdraw funds from your contract.

     > **Note** You can either use the following Ethereum addresses or create new, dummy addresses on the [Vanity-ETH](https://vanity-eth.tk/) website, 
     which includes an Ethereum vanity address generator.
    >
    > ```text
    > Dummy account1 address: 0x0c0669Cd5e60a6F4b8ce437E4a4A007093D368Cb
    > Dummy account2 address: 0x7A1f3dFAa0a4a19844B606CD6e91d693083B12c0
    > ```

2. Test the deposit functionality of your smart contract by sending the following amounts of ether. After each transaction, use the `contractBalance` function to verify that the funds were added to your contract:

    * Transaction 1: Send 1 ether as wei.

    * Transaction 2: Send 10 ether as wei.

    * Transaction 3: Send 5 ether.

    > **Note** Remembering how to convert ether to wei and vice versa can be challenging. So, you can use a website like [Ethereum Unit Converter](https://eth-converter.com/) to ease doing the conversion.

3. Once you’ve successfully deposited funds into your contract, test the contract’s withdrawal functionality by withdrawing 5 ether into `accountOne` and 10 ether into `accountTwo`. 
After each transaction, use the `contractBalance` function to verify that the funds were withdrawn from your contract. 
Also, use the `lastToWithdraw` and `lastWithdrawAmount` functions to verify that the address and amount were correct.
